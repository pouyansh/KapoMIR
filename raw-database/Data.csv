Alexander on Saturday delivered the Weekly Republican Address with a focus on education, specifically a long-term fix on student loans and a Republican plan for K-12 education that â€œputs Washington out of the business of deciding whether local schools are succeeding or failing.â€ù  In his remarks, Alexander said Senate Republicans â€œwill work hard with the President and the Houseâ€ù on a long-term student loans solution. He also described â€œa major disagreementâ€ù with Democrats on K-12 education, saying, â€œTo put it simply, Democrats want a national school board; Republicans favor local control.â€ù http://1.usa.gov/18RoHWj"

766194992,"Congressman Ron DeSantis endorses Rep. RaÃºl R. Labrador for Republican majority leader:  This week, the House Republican Conference will vote to elect a new Majority Leader for the House of Representatives to fill the position currently held by Eric Cantor. The defeat of a sitting House Majority Leader is unprecedented, and, by my lights, represented a firm rebuke to the Washington, DC establishment. The question is: will House Republicans get the message?  The vote is by secret ballot, but I believe that members should be transparent with their constituents and disclose who they support. I will be voting for Congressman RaÃºl Labrador.  RaÃºl Labrador is a conservative reformer who will stand for liberty and challenge Washington sacred cows. He is also a skilled communicator who is capable of articulating limited government principles to a broad cross-section of Americans. I am happy to support a change agent like RaÃºl for the position of House Majority Leader.  Below is a good take from Hugh Hewitt about what RaÃºl would bring to the table as the next House Majority Leader.  http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-California/2014/06/16/Hewitt-Raul-Labrador-as-Majority-Leader-Can-Stun-the-Media-Elites-and-Shake-Up-America"

I am a cosponsor of the amendment. The amendment is nearly identical to Rep. Rohrabacher's amendment from 2012, which I also supported. Here's my previous vote explanation: http://facebook.com/repjustinamash/posts/398285686877510.  Two years ago, the amendment failed 163-262. This year, the amendment was agreed to 219-189."

The long title of a bill is meant to provide a summary of its purpose or scope. The purpose of this bill is not ""to protect anonymous special interests."" The amendment was not agreed to 177-241."

The structured rule (only certain amendments allowed) provides for one hour of debate equally divided between the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. All points of order against consideration of the bill or the amendments are waived. Twenty-six amendmentsâ€”including seven from Democrats and four bipartisan proposalsâ€”are in order, and one motion to recommit (return the bill to committee) with or without instructions may be offered.

This bill is substantially similar to H R 2682 from the 112th Congress, which I also supported.

DHS has reportedly purchased as many as 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition over the last year, with even more purchases planned.

766195003,"Senator Ayotte released the following statement regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs patient access audit released today, which found that more than 57,000 veterans are currently waiting for appointments at VA facilities across the country.

The largest amphibious invasion in history, it was the beginning of a hard fight across the continent and the first crack in Germany's Fortress Europe. It paved the way for total victory for the Allies and another triumph over evil. Let's all remember those brave souls who lost their lives that day, and in the days that followed, so that we all may remain free to this day."

766195128,"I was very proud to lead a group of my colleagues in speaking on the floor of the House last night to promote and support H.R. 3685, the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act.  This legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The bill has more than 80 cosponsors, including members of both parties.  An unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances.  This really took me by surprise â€“ the fact that the ACA could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine.  That would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether.  Simply put: This is a public safety issue.  Iâ€™ve been concerned that since the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) currently views volunteer firefighters as employees, fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine, saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety.  I sent the IRS a letter in November requesting a clarification, but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today.  Under the Employer Mandate Provision, employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties.  This could be problematic for fire companies, particularly in Pennsylvania where 97-percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers.  Fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways: by themselves based on their size, by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs, or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total.    Some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think, â€œWell, weâ€™ve only got 25 volunteers so weâ€™re safe.  We donâ€™t have fifty.â€ù That may not necessarily be the case.  Some fire companies are considered part of their local government.  That could mean that if you take the number of firefighters â€“ paid and unpaid â€“ now considered employees by the IRS, and add them to the number of other public employees, you can easily reach fifty, even in a small town.â€ù"

This is unacceptable, and it took far too long for the US Federal Highway Administration to start asking the right questions.

Allowing employers to force their own religious beliefs on their employees under the guise of religious freedom is inexplicable. The Supreme Court has put the health of American women at risk while opening the door for private employers who are looking for a reason not to comply with the law.  Whether a woman uses contraception should be a private decision not subject to a financial veto by her employer. The Affordable Care Act guarantees the majority of women coverage for comprehensive preventive health services, including contraception.  Imposing additional financial burdens on a woman because her employer claims to hold certain beliefs contrary to the law sets a dangerous precedent.  #NotMyBossBusiness"

The maximum number before was in the three hundreds. When Lisa Jackson was confirmed, there were about 100 questions asked.    This has been a pattern on the Republican side of the aisle with obstructing President Obamaâ€™s nominations. Yesterday we saw, in one of our committees, a technical rule used to block the vote for Tom Perez to be Secretary of Labor.

766195238,"This morning I offered an amendment to reform the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full Senate that would extend unemployment benefits. My amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force.   The amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving EUC benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work (defined as work within their capabilities) or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency. States would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws.     We need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits. I have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in Indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out. This undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment.   We are waiting to see if Majority Leader Harry Reid will allow votes on Republican amendments."

Among other things, the legislation expands veteransâ€™ access to care by allowing those faced with lengthy wait times to seek private medical care outside of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system.  When called upon to serve, our nationâ€™s veterans bravely did so without hesitation or delay. In return, they should not be forced to wait inordinate amounts of time for quality medical treatment. In addition to establishing more permanent fixes to begin addressing the widespread failures within the agency, this measure is particularly beneficial to rural Idahoans, allowing veterans living more than 40 miles away from a VA facility to seek private health services.

While fighting the Japanese on the island of Bataan, outnumbered and under equipped, Dyess and his comrades surrendered to the enemies on April 10, 1942, and were marched to a prisoner-of-war camp in the infamous â€œBataan Death March.â€ù Nearly a year later, Dyess and nine other American prisoners-of-war, along with two Filipino convicts broke out of the Davao Penal Colony, an escape-proof Imperial Japanese Army prison plantation in the Philippines.  Lt. Col Dyess was awarded Distinguished Flying Cross and Distinguished Service Cross, for his valor.  He died on Dec. 22, 1943 in Burbank, Calif., when he chose to pilot his P-38, which had caught fire, away from a heavily populated area, rather than parachuting to safety.

In the days before refrigeration, salt was essential for preserving meat and curing leather. The Bluffton-Tow Salt Works were one of a handful of sources of salt for the Confederacy.  During the war, every day the residents of Tow would produce 20 to 30 bushels of salt.  In 1852, David and Gideon Cowan and their mother, Ruth, were the first settlers in the area. Local Indians showed them salt beds near the Colorado River, which they developed into saltworks.  A year later, John F. Morgan and his family were the first settlers to live in the area.  They established a hat business, using beaver and other fur trapped locally.  William and Wilson Tow also moved to the area in 1853 and  named the nearby area in which they settled Tow Valley. I am proud of the rich history of the towns and cities in the 11th District.  Men like the Cowans and John Morgan are the type of entrepreneurs that built America and give me faith in our future."
766195334,"Less than two months after the Sept. 11th attacks on America, the historian Donald Kagen gave a lecture on the importance of a patriotic education for maintaining and strengthening our country.  Earlier this month he gave an expanded version of that lecture.  In the lecture, he said that for Thomas Jefferson the most important goals of education were civic and moral.   Kagan said, ""This was not meant to be a 'value free' exercise; on the contrary, its purpose was to communicate the special virtues of republican representative democracy, the dangers that threatened it, and the responsibility of its citizens to esteem and protect it. This education was to be a common experience for all citizens, rich and poor, for every one of them had natural rights and powers, and every one had to understand and esteem the institutions, laws and traditions of his country if it was to succeed."""
766195335,"The only pecan breeding program in the world is located in Brownwood, Texas. The U.S. Department of Agriculture site got its start in the 1930s when horticulturist Hamilton P. Traub began searching for a suitable site for pecan research.  That search led him to the Pecan Bayou.  The Pecan Breeding & genetics center has pecan varieties from throughout the world.  This afternoon, I met some of the very talented men in women working at the center.

766195336,"I was honored today to give the closing remarks for the West Texas Legislative Summit.  I discussed the Environmental Protection Agency's war against fossil fuels.  I warned those in attendance that the EPA is currently targeting coal, but they have fracking in their sights.  I also discussed the EPA's proposed rule that provides essentially no limit to their jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, despite the Supreme Court consistently recognizing that Congress limited the authority of the EPA under the Clean Water Act.  We have some challenges with water in West Texas. Those are challenges that need to be addressed by the men and women in West Texas and not EPA bureaucrats in Washington, DC.  I have been fighting these anti-energy efforts by the Obama Administration and will continue to do so.  Energy production in West Texas is the engine of our nation's economy and strengthens our national security. The men and women who are involved in the energy industry are creating jobs and making America a safer place."

Programs that help create jobs in Pennsylvania such as Community Development Block Grants and NIH medical research will likely face fewer cuts under this deal. In addition, overall deficit reduction will be approximately $20 billion higher under this agreement than without it. Moreover, the bill will allow us avoid another damaging government shutdown.

Cigna is requesting an average rate increase of 7.5 percent, and Humana has requested to raise rates by an average of 14.4 percent.

766195387,"Senator Corker has co-authored an amendment with Senator John Hoeven to bolster security on the nationâ€™s southern border as part of the immigration bill now being considered by the Senate. The Hoeven-Corker Southern Border Security Amendment would double the number of agents on the Mexican border and require implementation of a tough new border security plan before unlawful immigrants already in the country could be eligible for Lawful Permanent Residence (LPR) or Green Card status 10 years after enactment. The border security plan is based on the U.S. Border Patrolâ€™s assessment of what the agency would need to maximally secure the nationâ€™s southern border. The amendment also strengthens interior enforcement by requiring that officials enforce current immigration law and deter overstays by initiating removal proceedings for at least 90 percent of visa overstays. Ten years after enactment, the senatorsâ€™ measure requires all five of the following conditions to be met before LPR, or a Green Card status, could be granted:
 
 - The Department of Homeland Security, after consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Inspector General of the Department, and the Comptroller General of the United States (GAO), has submitted a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy to Congress that includes minimum requirements for each sector along the border as identified by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the plan has been deployed and is operational.  
 - The Border Patrol has deployed, maintained, and stationed 20,000 border patrol agents on the southern border in addition to the 18,500 agents already stationed there. This means an agent every 1,000 feet along the southern border.
 - An additional 350 miles of fencing has been completed (in addition to the 350 miles of fencing already on the ground).
 - The mandatory employment verification system has been fully implemented for all employers.
 - The mandated electronic entry/exit system has been fully implemented at all international air and sea ports of entry within the United States where U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers are currently deployed.

The Postal Service estimates it would save roughly $2 billion a year by moving to five-day delivery for some postal products. â€œThis is typical Washingtonâ€”wanting to have our cake and eat it, too.  We all know that we need to allow the Postal Service the flexibility to make necessary reforms and cut costs so it can operate more efficiently and effectively, and yet Congress continues to stand in the way.

766195444,"Obama Administration officials today celebrated the news that the U.S. is spending only $500 billion more than it takes in this year. Clearly those in the Administration are out of touch with the views of the American people. As our deficit swells, our debt spills over to the next generation.   Thatâ€™s why, during my time in Congress, I have focused on cutting wasteful spending in Washington. It is also why I voted in support of a budget that curbed discretionary spending, and why I co-sponsored the Balance Budget Amendment to relieve our national debt."

Davis on Military Intervention in Syria  The apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria is a human tragedy and our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives.  Much remains unknown about these events as of today and the Congress is beginning a debate on the issue.  My constituents are deeply concerned about events in Syria and they are searching for an appropriate response which will end the killing and move quickly toward a political solution to the war in Syria.  However they are overwhelmingly opposed to U.S. military intervention of any kind.  They are concerned about the morality of such action, they are concerned about the legality of such action, they are concerned about the loss of life resulting from such action, they are concerned about the effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of such action, they are concerned about such action involving us more deeply in the Civil War in Syria, they are concerned about what follow on conflict such action might trigger, they are concerned about sabotaging a possible agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons, they are concerned about the drawing resources and focus from critical immediate problems here at home.  I share all of those concerns and more.  I have been, and remain today, a staunch support of President Obama.  However, my first responsibility as a Member of Congress is to represent the interests and views of my constituents.  Calls, emails, letters and other forms of communication with my office are running 9 to 1 in opposition to any military intervention in Syria at this time.  Therefore, I am strongly leaning toward a NO vote on any military intervention.  I intend to continue to listen closely to President Obamaâ€™s statements and to the views of my constituents as this debate proceeds."

By all historical accounts this was the day that saved the world from tyranny.  It was an overwhelming honor to meet with many veterans, including my friend Jack Port recently featured as one of San Diego's attending heroes.  What was so impressive in meeting these veterans as they have reached or are approaching their nineties, is to acknowledge that many were not even in their twenties on that epoch day.  I will never forget how much I learned and the emotions I felt.  I wish I could have shared it with my Dad who served as a medic throughout the war but like so many of his compatriots moved on with his life and did not speak about his experience.  During his remarks, President Hollande of France quoted President Eisenhower: Americans were not sure what they were fighting for in Europe, but in liberating the concentration camps they knew what they were fighting against."

This living, breathing document stands as a testament to the ideals we all share and have long held as Americans. 
 
 Every bill I introduce here in the House of Representatives must be accompanied by a statement of constitutional authority, reestablishing that the Constitution remains the standard against which every piece of legislation must be compared. As a legislator, I personally carry a copy in my pocket at all times as a reminder of the work many representatives have accomplished before me, as well as the ongoing challenge of defending its fundamental tenets during all policy discussions.

766195562,"I have written before about President Obama's apparent failure to read his daily security briefings. I think this comment from him sums up exactly what I mean (throwing Clapper under the bus along the way):  'Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper,' Obama said, 'has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.'  But in reality, the Administration was warned all along about the rise of ISIS/ISIL.  Defense Intelligence Director, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had warned President Obama and repeated that info to Congress:  From the attached article:  'By February [2014] we had generals basically reading out their memos to Congress,' he added, referring to testimony from Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn predicted ISIS 'probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014.' The Islamist terror group had already seized Fallujah and Ramadi, he said, had the 'ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria.' By the time Flynn spoke on Capitol Hill, Congress had already heard the story at least once before. Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in November 2013 that ISIS had been militarily active all year because of 'a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of Iraqi security forces, poor operational tactics, and popular grievances, which remain unaddressed.' 'It has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in Syria, control of lucrative facilities there, such as oil wells, and regular movement of weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq,' McGurk said."

With oil and gas development happening in N. Dakota and Texas (State and private lands btw is where it is happening - and it could boom in Pennsylvania & New York with Marcellus Shale as well as California with Monterey Shale and Alaska with ANWR / NPR), supplies are way up from increased production coupled with a sluggish global economy which has resulted in soft demand.  Throw technological advances in there, too, for a complete picture of the oil and gas boom we are seeing.  I say the boom is happening in spite of Obama Administration policies.

Amendments also passed to remove federally mandated teacher evaluation requirements and to make Title I dollars portable for public schools and charter schools, if a state so chooses.  I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my facebook posts asking for feedback on this issue. I read them all, and your feedback helped me make decisions on dozens of amendments and on the overall passage of this bill.

Boko Haram forced the girls to don Islamic dress and recite verses from the Koran.  They plan to sell the girls as brides to Islamic men.  Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekauâ€™s recent speech provided with stark clarity the motivation of the group.  Shekau said the attack is part of a â€œJihad war against Christians and Christianity.  It is a war against western education, democracy and constitutionâ€_ Allah said we should finish them when we get them.â€ù  In his speech, Shekau cited his Islamic faith in support of abolishing religious freedom, slaughtering Christians and Jews, selling girls into slavery, raping girls as young as 9 years old, and assassinating the President of the United States.

766195656,"Day 30: It may be the last day of the #SamFarrChallenge but for me it's the beginning of a healthier year. Why not extend it to the end of the year?   The walking was a wonderful challenge. Most days I made it 7,000 steps or more. Some days way over, while others as low as 4,000 but it has made a difference. Hardest part for me was the bed time snacks and of course the ice cream. I can't completely give it up but I can limit the amount. I found alcohol wasn't a problem though occasionally hard during a late dinner with friends. I limited it to 1 or 2 glasses of red wine and then rest of the evening drank water.   I found my weight fluctuated during the challenge. I lost some and gained back some over the past few weeks. Thankfully, overall it was a net loss. I am now going to try and lose 25 more lbs over the year.   Thank you for all the kind notes during the challenge. They really helped keep going on the first lap. Of course I want to thank Mary for inspiring me to do this challenge. Her helpful hints made us all better informed about the consequences of the food we eat. Finally, congratulations to everyone who completed the challenge. It was a lot of fun doing this as a group and I hope you all feel healthier.

766195956,"Yesterday, speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives, I shared a story that is close to my heart. A few years ago, my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart. Due to her advanced age, the doctors believed that surgery was too risky. A few years later that aneurysm got worse, endangering her life. She was re-evaluated, and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery.  Putting her faith in her doctors, in our healthcare system and in her god, she chose to have the surgery. Fortunately she made a full recovery. However, none of this would have been possible without Medicare. My mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker, and did not have a private pension or any option other than Medicare. As Congressional Republicans look for an easy way out on these issues, it is people like my mother who are left behind. This is a personal issue to me and the millions of American families with similar stories.  Republicans have tried for years to destroy Medicare by turning it in to a voucher program. They would break the promise we made to our nationâ€™s seniors, that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age. Medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country, boasting an overhead of only 2%. The problem isnâ€™t Medicare; itâ€™s the rising cost of healthcare.   One major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other. We must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare. As the Representative of Silicon Valley, I have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine, personal health connected devices, and other tools. I will be reintroducing the Healthcare Innovation and Marketplace Technologies Act later this year to continue this effort. Most importantly, however, I will continue to stand with my friends here in the Congress to protect Medicare and the Medicare guarantee."
766195957,"I applaud the Presidentâ€™s speech tonight regarding jobs and technology.

If we renew our national commitment to winning the manufacturing jobs of the future, bringing Silicon Valley sense to Washington, and employ strategies that play to our nationâ€™s natural strengths, we should see a new golden age of American manufacturing."

766196023,"Today's jobs report is no cause for celebration. The reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate is because Americans are leaving the workforce.  In fact, the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years! We need to focus on creating an environment where innovation, small business, and entrepreneurship can thrive.    That means removing roadblocks to job creation like ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank and  making America more energy independent.  At the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people ""left behind"" by the government's calculation.   Read more from The Associated Press:  The drop in the unemployment rate in August to a 4Â_-year low was hardly cause for celebration. The rate fell because more people stopped looking for work.  More than 300,000 people stopped working or looking for a job. Their exodus shrank the so-called labor force participation rate â€” the percentage of adult Americans with a job or seeking one â€” to 63.2 percent. It's the lowest participation rate since August 1978.  Once people without a job stop looking for one, the government no longer counts them as unemployed. That's why the unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July even though 115,000 fewer people said they had jobs.  If those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work, the unemployment rate would have risen to 7.5 percent in August.  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/why-fewer-working-age-americans-are-working"

Mrs. Oâ€™Connor grew up in Arizona and later attended Stanford University in 1950, earning a bachelorâ€™s degree in economics. After graduating she attended the universityâ€™s law school and received her degree in 1952. During this time, there were few opportunities for women in the law field. Mrs. Oâ€™Connor struggled to find work but was able to work for the county attorney for Californiaâ€™s San Mateo County for free, but soon became the deputy county attorney. From 1965 to 1969, she served as the stateâ€™s assistant attorney general. In 1969, she became state senator by filling a vacancy, and then won re-election twice. In 1979 she was selected to serve on the stateâ€™s court of appeals. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated her for associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and she received unanimous approval from the U.S. Senate. Mrs. Oâ€™Connor made history as the first woman justice to serve on the Supreme Court.  She married John Jay Oâ€™Connor in 1952 and had three sons. She stepped down from the bench on January 31, 2006 to spend more time with her husband, who suffered from Alzheimerâ€™s.

This deal is not perfect, but compromises rarely are.

Nothing is more important than providing our veterans with the care and respect that they have earned. It was a privilege to serve as a chief negotiator on the VA Reform Conference Committee. I am pleased that we were able to come to a bipartisan solution. These reforms expand the private sector care options available to our veterans, ensuring that wait times are lower, and convenience is increased.  However, this alone will not fix the cultural problems that plague the department so as to guarantee quality care for our veterans in the long run.  That's why I worked hard to ensure that the bill included measures that will hold bureaucrats accountable for failing to put our veterans first.   These are important steps in the process of rebuilding the trust that has been broken between our brave veterans and the VA that should serve them. The corrupt culture at the VA won't be purged overnight and there is still a lot of work to do.  I will continue to work with local veterans on individual cases and on the Veterans Affairs Committee to address systemic problems that remain.  http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20140728/CRPT-113hrpt-HR3230-Joint.pdf"

Then, the GOP agreed to raise the debt ceiling, but not open the government, as their ""compromise,""(http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/10/politics/shutdown-showdown/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_allpolitics+(RSS%3A+Politics))....but only if it was a 6 week debt ceiling agreement...and only if was tied to conversations about how to fix our long term deficit...and only if those conversations were about cuts, and not revenues.(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-greenstein/while-government-remains_b_4066052.html)   And then, they called that tactic moving ""halfway."" (http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/10/boehner_we_re_meeting_halfway_on_what_obama_wants.html).  What's next? Who knows what the GOP will do.  But make no mistake: People across this country- children(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/10/government-shutdown-wic_n_4073146.html), military families(http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57606695/government-shutdown-hitting-veterans-military-families-hard/), seniors(http://abc10up.com/govt-shutdown-stops-food-delivery-seniors/), and many more are being hurt by this shutdown....with more to be impacted the longer this goes on. (http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/10/10/2761511/food-stamps-automatic-cuts/).  This is a manufactured politically motivated crisis that never had to start, and could end tonight if the GOP leadership would just let us vote on a clean budget. Let's truly make this a ""once upon a time"" story, and end this shutdown. #DemandAVote"

Providing an earned pathway to citizenship is also important for our national and economic security. And as a member of the Gang of 8, I can say we have had tough negotiations, but the progress towards bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform is real. We're almost there and God willing the bipartisan framework we put forward will pass both chambers with strong support and land on the President's desk and be signed into law this year.

Veterans who have served our nation with duty and honor deserve access to quality health care when they need it. Because Kansas is a rural state, many of our veterans are already forced to travel long distances to visit a VA hospital. Now, Topeka veterans are losing access to the emergency care services they could need at any moment. This is outrageous. It is far past time for Secretary Shinseki and the VA to do their job. I have asked time and again about their failure to address the tremendous shortage of VA physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants.

This requires a global response, including the on-going commitment by U.S. civilian and military personnel. For this crucial humanitarian relief mission, it is no surprise that the Pentagon is calling on Minnesotaâ€™s Red Bulls with their proven record of expertise, skill, and resourcefulness.  While they will not be treating patients, their mission is vital to containing this virus in Africa and ultimately saving lives.   As with any mission, the health and safety of our soldiers are my highest priorities. I have been working with the U.S. Department of Defense for months to ensure that U.S. troops are trained and ready to assist in this important work, and that extra steps are being taken to protect their health, including providing personal protective equipment and training about the disease.  I will also work to ensure our soldiers receive the compensation and benefits they deserve during this deployment.  The citizen-soldiers of the Red Bull 34th Infantry Division Headquarters are leaders of the highest caliber, having been called on combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and Bosnia. With this deployment to Liberia, our Minnesota Red Bulls will once again have the support and gratitude of the American people.

766196424,"Today I voted NO along with every House Democrat, on the GOP-Ryan Budget, which is a disastrous for our economy, our families, and the future of our country. Imagine this:  if the GOP budget actually became law, it would result in 2 million lost jobs in 2014 alone (according to the Economic Policy Institute).   Instead of common sense investments, such as growing the economy, creating jobs, and strengthening our families, this Republican budget is harmful.  It lowers taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while 66% of the non-defense budget cuts come from programs helping low or moderate income families.  The GOP cuts and guts $3.7 trillion over the next decade from programs like Pell Grants for college students, job training for dislocated workers, nutrition programs for poor children, and healthcare for our most vulnerable citizens.   Congress needs to move forward with a balanced approach to address deficit reduction â€“ increased revenues, elimination of special interest tax breaks, smart cuts to failing programs, and investments in growing the economy."

McKinley.  â€œSpending is lower than when President Obama took office so weâ€™re making progress, but thereâ€™s still a lot more to be done.â€ù  â€œAdopting a budget for the first time since the President took office puts spending priorities back in the control of Congress rather than at the discretion of the President,â€ù added McKinley. â€œCongress can now focus on rooting out government waste and abuse and meet our priority of cutting the deficit.â€ù  Some of the Highlights of the Funding Bill Benefitting the First District:  â€¢No new funding for Obamacare (Affordable Care Act); reduces â€œslush fundsâ€ù by $1 billion; and cuts $10 billion in funding for the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) created by Obamacare. â€¢Provides an additional $132 million for fossil fuel research and development at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in Morgantown. â€¢Reduces EPA funding by $2.1 billion by scaling back regulatory overreach while enhancing oversight on climate change programs and the mining permit process. â€¢Includes a military retiree pension â€œfixâ€ù to ensure disabled veterans and surviving families receive the full benefits they are due. â€¢Increases funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) by $12 million. â€¢Provides over $3 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG). â€¢Prevents the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp. from prohibiting funding for international coal plant projects.  â€œAfter voting against the budget proposal in December, the Committee listened to our objections and reworked this bill making it more acceptable,â€ù said McKinley.  â€œNow it provides needed funds for areas like the First District and makes targeted cuts to broken programs.

 Washington, D.C. â€”Today, Rep. David B. McKinley, P.E. (R-WV) was joined by 17 of his colleagues, the majority of which is Eagle Scouts, in supporting the on-going National Boy Scout Jamboree being held this week in Fayette County, W.Va.  
 
 This is the first time the Jamboree has been held in the Mountain State, and the event brought nearly 50,000 Scouts, leaders, volunteers and others to the new site.  The first Boy Scout Jamboree took place in 1937 in Washington, D.C.
 
 â€œAs an Eagle Scout, I could not be more proud that my home state of West Virginia is hosting the Jamboree and will serve as the permanent home for the event in the coming years,â€ù said Rep. McKinley.  â€œThis week, thousands of Scouts from around the United States, their leaders and others have travelled to the new facility near the New River Gorge to celebrate Scouting and participate in activities to build leadership and character.â€ù
 
 The site, known as the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve, will house Scouts, staff and adult leaders, who will enjoy the outdoors and test their abilities in a number of ways.  
 
 Rep. McKinleyâ€™s office also helped in sending 90-year-old Carlyle Farnsworth, a Wheeling resident, to this yearâ€™s Jamboree.  Farnsworth is also an Eagle Scout and attended the first jamboree back in 1937.
 
 â€œThe lessons I learned as a young man in the Boy Scouts in Troops 23 and 6 in Wheeling, W.Va., have stuck with me throughout my life and guided my decisions in my personal and professional career,â€ù added McKinley.  â€œI look forward to talking with the campers and touring the site, first-hand, this weekend.â€ù

Please SHARE his press release:  H.R. 3436: THE NSA INSPECTOR GENERAL ACT OF 2013   WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Yesterday, Representative Mark Sanford (SC-1), along with ten Republicans (including the rest of the South Carolina Republican delegation) and two Democrats, introduced H.R. 3436, The National Security Agency Inspector General Act of 2013, in the House of Representatives:   â€œWith information continuing to drip out regarding activities at the NSA that at best raise questions about the legality of their conduct and at worst are in direct violation of the Constitution, yesterday I introduced legislation to help correct this behavior, by making the NSA Inspector General (IG) position a presidential appointment, to be confirmed by the Senate,â€ù said Sanford. â€œThis process already exists at the CIA, Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.â€ù   â€œRight now, the IG is appointed by the Director of the NSA, which curbs their oversight effectiveness because the Director can remove them,â€ù added Sanford. â€œAs recently noted in an op-ed by the former IG of the CIA, Britt Snider, this lack of independence creates an environment where employees of the IGâ€™s office worry about their careers if their findings and conclusions are critical of the agency.â€ù   â€œThere are a number of reforms that need to be made at the NSA to ensure the Agency is not violating the privacy of Americans, but without a robust IG office, these reforms will lack the teeth they need to be enforced. In this vein, I feel this legislation is a reasonable and necessary step that will help bring positive change to the Agency.â€ù   Representative Sanford was joined in introducing H.R. 3436 by the following original co-sponsors (listed in order of co-sponsorship):   1. Paul Broun (R, GA-10) 2. Mick Mulvaney (R, SC-05) 3. Alan Grayson (D, FL-09) 4. Kerry Bentivolio (R, MI-11) 5. Tom Rice (R, SC-07) 6. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D, DC) 7. Thomas Massie (R, KY-04) 8.

766196610,"Yesterday I introduced legislation to jumpstart the economy, grow the middle class, and fight income inequality. Read the press release below to find out more:  (WASHINGTON, DC / January 27, 2014): Congressman Richard E. Neal, Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Select Revenue Subcommittee, last week introduced legislation to jumpstart the sluggish economy, finance critical infrastructure investments, fight income inequality and create jobs.  The Invest in US Act, extends and reauthorizes key bond measures beneficial for our states and municipalities, extends several critical tax credit initiatives, sets up an infrastructure bank, increases the minimum wage and provides small businesses with tax relief.  ""Right now the U.S. economy is stuck in a rut, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high and the growing income inequality in America threatens to derail our economy altogether,""  Neal said.  ""In December 2013, we saw the economy only add 74,000 jobs, our lowest since 2011.  According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, in 2013 the economy averaged adding 183,000 jobs a month.  At this current rate, the Federal Reserve says the unemployment rate will remain above 6.5 percent until 2015.  This is simply unacceptable, and America can do better, and we must.   The recession has wiped out 8 million jobs, and it is imperative that we get them back.  That is why I introduced the Invest in US Act.  This legislation will go a long way in creating an environment where our economy can take off by making the strategic investment needed to spur growth.  Furthermore, the legislation takes full aim at the growing income inequality by increasing the minimum wage, while also providing tax relief for businesses that hire new employees and buy new equipment."" Below please find a summary of the legislation.  The Invest in US Act at a glance: Tax Provisions â€¢ New Markets Tax Credit â€“Extends and expands the New Markets Tax Credit program.  The New Markets Tax Credit program is made permanent, with an allocation amount of $5 billion annually.  By permanently extending the NMTC, the legislation ensures that communities will continue to receive investments they need to renew, rebuild and refurbish neighborhoods for generations to come. â€¢ Build America Bonds (BABs) â€“ Makes the BABs program permanent, starting with a 32 percent subsidy rate in 2013, and phasing down to a 28 percent subsidy rate in 2017 and thereafter.  BABs unleash job creation, economic growth and spur private-sector investments in infrastructure.  From the inception of the program in April 2009 to when it expired at the end of 2010, there were 2,275 separate BABs issues, which supported more than $181 billion of financing for new public capital infrastructure projects, such as schools, bridges and hospitals. â€¢ Research and Development Tax Credit. Makes permanent and expands the R&D Tax Credit.  The legislation also increases the the rate of the Alternative Simplified Credit (ASC) from 14 to 17 percent. â€¢ AMT repeal on Private Activity Bonds â€“ Eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on private activity bonds (PABs).  PABs are a form of municipal bonds that are used by a variety of public and non-profit entities such as airports, seaports and student loan issuers.  The AMT penalty attached to these bonds results in higher interest rates which correlate to higher infrastructure project costs and higher student loan rate burdens. â€¢ Facility Water & Sewer Bonds â€“ Exempts water and sewer projects from the private activity bond (PAB) cap.  Currently, the tax code limits the amount of tax-exempt private activity bond debt that can be issued annually in a state.  The legislation excludes the PABs issued by water and sewage facilities from the state volume cap.  Removing the volume cap makes additional private investment capital available for these types of infrastructure facilities. â€¢ Work Opportunity Tax Credit. - Makes the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) permanent.  The tax credit expired at the end of 2013.  The WOTC provides a federal tax credit up to $9,600 for businesses that hire targeted individuals.  Since 1996, the WOTC has expired numerous times.  Making the credit permanent will end the uncertainty surrounding the credit for employers and potential hires. â€¢ Jobs Training Tax Credit.  The legislation incorporates Senator Menendez's common sense proposal that links community colleges with local businesses to train employees.  Like Senator Menendez's proposal, this bill provides $1 billion in funding for a competitive tax-credit initiative that encourages colleges and businesses to form job-training partnerships.  The proposal also would provide a community college tuition tax credit of up to $4,000 to any U.S. based business that trains a long-term unemployed person for an open job that requires a certain type of certificate or other training credential. â€¢ Extends Increased Business Expensing.  This provision permanently extends the 2013 section 179 expensing and investment limitations of $500,000 and $2 million.  This provision is effective for qualifying property placed in service after December 31, 2013. â€¢ Permanent of the 15-Year Depreciation Schedule. Makes permanent the 15-year depreciation schedule for leasehold improvements, restaurant improvements and new construction, and retail improvements.  Currently this is a temporary provision that must be extended annually.  By making this provision permanent we are providing businesses with the certainty they need to undertake capital expenditures, which fuel economic activity and create jobs.  Other Provisions â€¢ Infrastructure Bank.  In 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United State's infrastructure a grade of D+ and estimated that the US will need to invest an additional $1.6 trillion to fix our infrastructure.  The Invest in US Act creates the American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA), which is an independent, wholly-owned government infrastructure bank, to assist in funding some of the critical infrastructure needs.  Under the proposal, Department of Treasury will make available $10 billion in seed money to encourage private investment in public works projects.  It is estimated that this self- sustaining entity could be capable of leveraging as much as $625 billion in private investment by issuing direct loans, loan guarantees, bonds and debt securities.  To keep both the costs and risks low, the AIFA is also barred from financing more than 50 percent of any one project. Increase in Minimum Wage.  The legislation increases the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from the current $7.25.  This increase is phased in over four years and in three increments of 95 cents.  Thereafter, the minimum wage will increase as the cost of living increases."

766196655,"This morning Fort Bliss officials announced that some radiation contamination has been detected in a weapons storage building at Biggs Airfield. 
 
 Fort Bliss officials are working closely with the U.S. Air Force Safety Center, the Army Environmental Command and other appropriate agencies to determine the nature and specific extent of the contamination. In the meantime, the area has been closed off to all personnel. Additional environmental and medical evaluations are expected in about a week. 
 
 The affected bunker and other nearby bunkers were once used to assemble nuclear bomb sections. They are currently used to store equipment for National Guard units that are preparing for deployment.
 
 I have been in contact with Major General MacFarland and I am working with him and Fort Bliss leadership to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to protect, inform, and help anyone who might have been affected.
 
 For the latest information, please visit the El Paso Times website: http://bit.ly/17ioFSU. 
 
 Fort Bliss has set up a number of hotlines for people to learn more about the situation. Please call (915) 744-1255, (915) 744-1962, (915) 744-8263 or (915) 744-8264 for more information."
766196656,"Today, the House is debating the National Defense Authorization Act. I took to the floor to speak in support of an amendment that would bring our troops home from Afghanistan.  This amendment would ensure that the President sticks to his timetable to end U.S. combat operations and transfer operations to the Government of Afghanistan by the end of this year.  Since the start of the Afghanistan War, more than 41 soldiers at Fort Bliss have lost their lives; countless others are returning to our community with unseen mental injuries and PTSD. These terrible losses should focus us on our solemn responsibility to know when to bring our soldiers home to their families.   Our soldiers and their families have sacrificed mightily for our nation during the twelve years we have been at war. Thanks to their service, Osama bin Laden is dead, the Taliban and Al Queda have been weakened and the Afghan people have been given the opportunity, should they choose to take it, to form a stable and democratic state. Now is the right time to bring them home to their families."

766196660,"Today, the Senate introduced a plan for comprehensive immigration reform.   The plan is a tremendous step toward fixing our broken immigration system and strengthening El Paso.  For the first time in over three decades, Congress has the opportunity to pass a serious comprehensive immigration reform bill. It has the support of a broad coalition of leaders, including members of both parties and business, labor, and immigration advocacy groups. It goes a long way in addressing critical concerns- it creates a path to citizenship for immigrants that pay their taxes, obey our laws and learn English. It also helps reunite broken families, gives young DREAMers an opportunity to pursue their goals and directs resources towards securing our border.  El Paso will be uniquely impacted by whatever bill Congress passes and I am committed to making sure our voice is heard in this debate. Our community has long dealt with the consequences of both long wait times at our ports and immigration laws that break up families and ignore economic conditions. I look forward to reviewing the entire bill more in depth, but it is a great first step to fixing our immigration system. I hope that Congress rises to the challenge and passes comprehensive immigration reform this year.  For a full copy of my statement, click on the link below."

I was brought up in a small town where I knew the shame and dishonor of race hatred.  I grew to despise it because it threatened the happiness of you, and you, and you!""

This law was crafted behind closed doors and rammed through Congress on a partisan voteâ€”and the results have been disastrous. As a result, millions have been kicked off their healthcare plans or have seen their premiums skyrocket, while businesses have been forced to cut-back their workforces. Thatâ€™s why I introduced legislation to create an independent watchdog to monitor Obamacare, which would help bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the Presidentâ€™s healthcare law. #GruberGate"

Delaying the employer mandateâ€”while preserving the requirement that individuals purchase insuranceâ€”only postpones the inevitable catastrophe that is Obamacare.

But I cannot support a plan that increases our nationâ€™s debt by half a TRILLION dollars while offering no spending reforms. Washingtonâ€™s addiction to spending is what led to this mess, and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is exactly the wrong approach.  A better way forward would be honest, simple legislation that (1) takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms, (2) provides temporary government funding, and (3) allows us time to work toward a real budget. I know a majority of Republicans and Democrats would ultimately support such a plan. The problem is the â€˜shutdown strategyâ€™ damaged the Houseâ€™s bargaining power in these negotiations.  I hope conservatives can now regroup and begin work on achievable priorities that are important to regular Americans: striving to protect Americans from ObamaCareâ€™s harmful mandates and taxes, setting sustainable spending levels that continue to drive down the deficit, and pushing a pro-growth agenda that will help create jobs for people in Alabama and throughout the country. http://www.wsfa.com/story/23711725/rep-roby-to-vote-no-on"

Rather than discouraging the dangerous journey to our southern border, the Presidentâ€™s policies have continued the allusion that our country will accept everyone with open arms.

766196987,"This morning, we heard President Obama emphatically state that â€˜the world set a red-lineâ€™ regarding the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Assadâ€™s regime. Given his statement, I felt it was appropriate to ask Secretary Kerry during his testimony if the world would join the United States in responding with multi-lateral military force. Unfortunately, Secretary Kerryâ€™s response was unconvincing and led me to believe that the United States would be left to strike unilaterally and without a broad coalition of other nations.   During todayâ€™s hearing, the Obama Administration had an opportunity to make their case for military intervention in Syriaâ€™s long-standing civil war. After listening to todayâ€™s testimony, I am, at this time, opposed to the use of U.S. military force because the Administration failed to present a convincing argument that the events in Syria pose a clear threat to America, failed to list a strong coalition of nations willing to support military attacks, and failed to articulate a clear definition of victory. While the use of chemical weapons should not be tolerated by any nation or regime, the Administration has not clearly answered these important questions, and therefore, has yet to convince the American people that military action is necessary at this time."

Toward that end, the Speaker's office circulated the list below, and I thought you might find it of interest:  â€œI take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that weâ€™re facing right now have to do with [the president] trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. And thatâ€™s what I intend to reverse when Iâ€™m President of the United States of America.â€ù (3/31/08)  â€œWeâ€™ve got a government designed by the Founders so that thereâ€™d be checks and balances. You donâ€™t want a president whoâ€™s too powerful or a Congress thatâ€™s too powerful or a court thatâ€™s too powerful. Everybodyâ€™s got their own role. Congressâ€™s job is to pass legislation. The president can veto it or he can sign it. â€_ I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States. We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end-run around Congress.â€ù (5/19/08)  â€œComprehensive reform, that's how we're going to solve this problem. â€_ Anybody who tells you it's going to be easy or that I can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention to how this town works.â€ù (5/5/10)  â€œ[T]here are those in the immigrantsâ€™ rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are [here] illegally with legal status, or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws. ... I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. It would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. And this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration. And it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally. Ultimately, our nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship.  And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable.â€ù (7/1/10)  â€œI do have an obligation to make sure that I am following some of the rules. I can't simply ignore laws that are out there. I've got to work to make sure that they are changed.â€ù (10/14/10)  â€œI am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. I'm committed to making it happen, but I've got to have some partners to do it. â€_ The main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws. â€_ [T]he most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works â€“ again, I just want to repeat, I'm president, I'm not king. If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves. But there's a limit to the discretion that I can show because I am obliged to execute the law. That's what the Executive Branch means. I can't just make the laws up by myself. So the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws.â€ù (10/25/10)  â€œAmerica is a nation of laws, which means I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law. I don't have a choice about that. That's part of my job. But I can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants. â€_ With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, thatâ€™s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed â€_. [W]eâ€™ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branchâ€™s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President.â€ù (3/28/11)  â€œI can't solve this problem by myself. â€_ [W]e're going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen. â€_ I can't do it by myself. We're going to have to change the laws in Congress, but I'm confident we can make it happen.â€ù (4/20/11)  â€œI know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself.  But thatâ€™s not how democracy works.  See, democracy is hard.  But itâ€™s right. Changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one.â€ù (4/29/11)  â€œSometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But thatâ€™s not how a democracy works. What we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's what Iâ€™m committed to doing.â€ù (5/10/11)  â€œI swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books â€_. Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that's not how our system works. Thatâ€™s not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.â€ù (7/25/11)  â€œSo what weâ€™ve tried to do is within the constraints of the laws on the books, weâ€™ve tried to be as fair, humane, just as we can, recognizing, though, that the laws themselves need to be changed. â€_ The most important thing for your viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in order to change our laws, weâ€™ve got to get it through the House of Representatives, which is currently controlled by Republicans, and weâ€™ve got to get 60 votes in the Senate. â€_ Administratively, we can't ignore the law. â€_ I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.  We are doing everything we can administratively.  But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce.  And I think thereâ€™s been a great disservice done to the cause of getting the DREAM Act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, by myself, I can go and do these things.  Itâ€™s just not true. â€_ We live in a democracy.  You have to pass bills through the legislature, and then I can sign it.  And if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process, then that is going to lead to a constant dead-end. We have to recognize how the system works, and then apply pressure to those places where votes can be gotten and, ultimately, we can get this thing solved.â€ù (9/28/11)  In June 2012, President Obama unilaterally granted deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA), allowing â€œeligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety â€_ to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.â€ù He then argued that he had already done everything he could legally do on his own:  â€œNow, what Iâ€™ve always said is, as the head of the executive branch, thereâ€™s a limit to what I can do. Part of the reason that deportations went up was Congress put a whole lot of money into it, and when you have a lot of resources and a lot more agents involved, then there are going to be higher numbers. What weâ€™ve said is, letâ€™s make sure that youâ€™re not misdirecting those resources. But weâ€™re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally. And thatâ€™s why this continues to be a top priority of mine. â€_ And we will continue to make sure that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible. But until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization and/or citizenship for the folks in question, weâ€™re going to continue to be bound by the law. â€_ And so part of the challenge as President is constantly saying, â€˜what authorities do I have?â€™â€ù (9/20/12)  â€œWe are a nation of immigrants. â€_ But we're also a nation of laws. So what I've said is, we need to fix a broken immigration system. And I've done everything that I can on my own[.]â€ù (10/16/12)  â€œI'm not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law. And that's what we've done. But what I've also said is, let's make sure that we're applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That's the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law.â€ù (1/30/13)  â€œIâ€™m not a king. You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law.  And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, weâ€™ve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we canâ€™t simply ignore the law. When it comes to the dreamers, we were able to identify that group and say, â€˜These folks are generally not a risk. Theyâ€™re not involved in crime. â€_ And so letâ€™s prioritize our enforcement resources.â€™ But to sort through all the possible cases of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very difficult to do. This is why we need comprehensive immigration reform. To make sure that once and for all, in a way that is, you know, ratified by Congress, we can say that there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying out of trouble, who are trying to do the right thing, whoâ€™ve put down roots here. â€_ My job is to carry out the law. And so Congress gives us a whole bunch of resources. They give us an order that weâ€™ve got to go out there and enforce the laws that are on the books.  â€_ If this was an issue that I could do unilaterally I would have done it a long time ago. â€_ The way our system works is Congress has to pass legislation. I then get an opportunity to sign it and implement it.â€ù (1/30/13)  â€œThis is something Iâ€™ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that Iâ€™m the president of the United States, Iâ€™m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. And Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. And what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic.â€ù (2/14/13)  â€œI think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus. â€_ And weâ€™ve been able to provide help through deferred action for young people â€_. But this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively.â€ù (7/16/13)  â€œMy job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said â€˜here is the lawâ€™ when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they've allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement. And, what I have been able to do is to make a legal argument that I think is absolutely right, which is that given the resources that we have, we can't do everything that Congress has asked us to do. What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. â€_ But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option. â€_ What I've said is there is a there's a path to get this done, and that's through Congress.â€ù (9/17/13)  â€œ[I]f, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But weâ€™re also a nation of laws. Thatâ€™s part of our tradition. And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what Iâ€™m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. â€_ It is not simply a matter of us just saying weâ€™re going to violate the law. Thatâ€™s not our tradition. The great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy, and sometimes it is messy, and sometimes it is hard, but ultimately, justice and truth win out.â€ù (11/25/13)  â€œI am the Champion-in-Chief of comprehensive immigration reform. But what Iâ€™ve said in the past remains true, which is until Congress passes a new law, then I am constrained in terms of what I am able to do. What Iâ€™ve done is to use my prosecutorial discretion, because you canâ€™t enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million people, there arenâ€™t the resources there.  What weâ€™ve said is focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity, focus on people who are engaged in gang activity. Do not focus on young people, who weâ€™re calling DREAMers â€_. That already stretched my administrative capacity very far. But I was confident that that was the right thing to do. But at a certain point the reason that these deportations are taking place is, Congress said, â€˜you have to enforce these laws.â€™ They fund the hiring of officials at the department thatâ€™s charged with enforcing.  And I cannot ignore those laws any more than I could ignore, you know, any of the other laws that are on the books. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so important for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done this year.â€ù (3/6/14)  â€œI think that I never have a green light [to push the limits of executive power].  Iâ€™m bound by the Constitution; Iâ€™m bound by separation of powers.  There are some things we canâ€™t do. Congress has the power of the purse, for example. â€_ Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I donâ€™t have a green light. â€_ My preference in all these instances is to work with Congress, because not only can Congress do more, but itâ€™s going to be longer-lasting.â€ù (8/6/14)"

 Created on Thursday, 14 November 2013 00:00. | Written by Patrick Malee. | Print 
 
 by: TIDINGS PHOTO: VERN UYETAKE - U.S. Navy veterans Marlyn Miller and Daniel Larsen spoke to U.S. Congressman Kurt Schrader on Veterans Day about their exposure to toxic chemicals while in the service. 
 
 When Daniel Larsen stood up to speak at a mid-October town hall meeting hosted by U.S. Congressman Kurt Schrader, it wasnâ€™t to voice a complaint about the recent government shutdown or to discuss second amendment rights. 
 
 The issue he brought forward was very specific, one that he and scores of other Navy veterans had dealt with for years, yet remained unknown to officials like Schrader.

766197286,"The cost of health insurance premiums for a new customer in the individual market under ObamaCare will go up $151/month on average, and $130/month for those keeping their current plan. According to the White House, we have nothing to worry about since customers will receive a $100 average rebate each year to offset these increased monthly costs. That's right, a $100 rebate to offset an annual increased premium cost of $1812 for new customers and $1560 for existing customers.   The President's fuzzy math means that a lot of families and hardworking Americans are going to have to further tighten their belts to foot the bill for this bad law. This is wrong, which is why in the House we continue to fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare with alternatives that will keep costs low, and provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans--something this law fails to do."

Deporting these children and families isnâ€™t a realistic option.

Because the House wonâ€™t act, the president is justified in taking commonsense steps to fix our broken immigration system under existing law.   â€œThe president is offering a temporary solution to keep families together, give employers who hire workers on visas more certainty about their workforce, and devote our limited resources to deporting dangerous criminals.

Construction is expected for the next two years to help repair the Dome, the first restoration work to its exterior in more than 60 years.

State and local government employees have long been able to choose paid time off as compensation for working overtime hours, allowing these public-sector employees greater flexibility to meet family obligations. However, the federal government prohibits private-sector workers from enjoying this same benefit. 
 
 To remove this obstacle in federal law, the United States House of Representatives will be voting on the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2013.  This common-sense legislation allows employers to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked.  It is pro-family, pro-worker legislation that gives workers the flexibility to spend time with family, attend teacher conferences, care for aging parents, stay home with a newborn, or attend to other family needs that may arise.

After negotiations with the Senate, we dropped their demand to spend $500 billion by over 95%, while prioritizing care for our veterans and accountability for bureaucrats.   Provisions Include: *Provide immediate access to care outside the VA to those veterans still waiting to be seen by a doctor *Ability to quickly fire bad apples in the VA system  *Independent, private sector evaluation of the VA health care system *Reduces bonuses *Increases transparency in VA data reporting  This is an important step in fixing the VA, but not the last.

766197477,"For the past few weeks, I have been undecided, but leaning against, authorizing military strikes in Syria.  I was willing to remain open until President Obama could make his case to the American people, which he did from the East Room last night.  After listening to the speech, I have not been persuaded to support military action in Syria.  Unfortunately, the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives.  It also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike.  This is consistent with the lack of detail I have received in classified briefings with administration officials.  At the very least, clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before I would consider supporting military action.  I hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation.  But I also realize that a deal brokered by the Russians is unlikely to be, on balance, a very good deal, and will remain difficult to implement.  While we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out, the White House must engage Congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far."

766197483,"Today, I voted in favor of H.R. 5016 - Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2015. The bill stops the IRS from implementing Obamacare, prohibits funds for the IRS to enforce the individual mandate, and prohibits transfers of funds from Health and Human Services to the IRS for Obamacare.   It also prohibits the IRS from targeting individuals based on their political beliefs, cuts funding to the IRS by $341 million dollars, and prohibits funding for the Executive Office of the President to prepare signing statements and Executive Orders that contradict existing law.   This Administration has used the IRS as a weapon against citizens who disagree with him politically and heâ€™s used Executive Orders as a weapon against a Congress that disagrees with him legislatively. This bill takes away his ability to do both"
